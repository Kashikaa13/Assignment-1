Java Stack Implementations:
Two Java stack data structure implementations, FixedStack and GrowableStack, are included in this repository. These implementations include methods for adding and removing data from the stack as well as for determining whether the stack is empty. They comply with the IntStack interface.

Stack Implementations:

1. FixedStack:
The FixedStack class implements the IntStack interface using an array of fixed length. When attempting to push data onto a full stack, it displays a "Stack Overflow" message.

2. GrowableStack:
The GrowableStack class implements the IntStack interface using an array that dynamically grows in size when the stack is full. Upon reaching the maximum capacity, it doubles the size of the array to accommodate additional elements.

A straightforward command-line interface is offered by both implementations to communicate with the stacks.
To carry out required procedures, make sure you input correct choices in accordance with the menu instructions.
