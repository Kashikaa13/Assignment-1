PART 1:
Calculator for Shape

A Java programme for figuring out the areas of various forms, including triangles, rectangles, and circles, may be found in this repository. After receiving user input for each shape's dimensions, the programme calculates each shape's area.


1.Main.java: The main entry point of the program.
2.Circle.java: Class implementing the Shape interface for calculating the area of a circle.
3.Rectangle.java: Class implementing the Shape interface for calculating the area of a rectangle.
4.Triangle.java: Class implementing the Shape interface for calculating the area of a triangle.
5.Shape.java: Interface defining the contract for calculating the area of various shapes.

PART2:
System for Employee Management

A Java programme for maintaining employee information and determining their pay depending on a number of factors, including base pay, bonuses, allowances, and deductions, may be found in this repository.


1.Employee Classification: Workers are divided into two groups: regular workers and bonus workers. While bonus employees may receive additional bonuses based on specific criteria, normal employees receive a predetermined basic wage.

2.Interactive Input: The application asks users to enter information on employees, including name, department, bank account, and address. This makes it possible to personalise employee profiles.

3.Compensation Calculation: The programme determines each employee's compensation by taking into account their base pay, any applicable bonuses, deductions (such ESI and EPF), and allowances (including HRA, transportation, and medical).

4.Flexible Bonus System: Employees can choose to receive bonuses, with user input determining the percentage that will be awarded. This gives added computations flexibility.
