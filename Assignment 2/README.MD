EvenOddArray.java: This Java program segments numbers provided by the user into two distinct arrays, 'even' and 'odd', based on their parity. It first asks the user for the number of elements they intend to input and then proceeds to collect each element. Subsequently, the program distributes these elements into separate arrays depending on whether they are even or odd. Finally, it displays the contents of each array.

NearestNeighbours.java: This Java program features a method called findNearest() designed to identify two adjacent numbers within an array that possess the smallest numerical gap between them. The program solicits an array of integers from the user and proceeds to locate and output the index of the first number in the array with the shortest distance to its adjacent counterpart. In cases where the array is either empty or contains less than two elements, the program raises an IllegalArgumentException.

ArrayArrayListConversion.java: This Java program showcases the conversion process between an array and an ArrayList. It comprises two distinct methods: one responsible for converting an array into an ArrayList and the other for converting an ArrayList back into an array. The program initializes both an array and an ArrayList, executes the conversion procedures, and then presents the converted arrays to illustrate the conversion mechanism.
